# Hangman
## Table of Contents

## Description
This project is based on the game, *Hangman*. The python code has five fruits listed and asks the user to input a single letter. If the letter is in the word then they get a 'good guess' response. If not, they have to try another letter. This repeats until they have successfully spelt out the letters of the word selected.
The aim of the project is to consolidate all the learning I have done so far with AI Core Skills.
I have learnt a great deal about python, machine learning and Git. But overall I have learnt that I need to invest in a new laptop that enables me to code more efficiently.
