# Hangman
## Description
This project is based on the game, *Hangman*. The python code has five fruits listed and asks the user to input a single letter. If the letter is in the word then they get a 'good guess' response. If not, they have to try another letter. This repeats until they have successfully spelt out the letters of the word selected.
The aim of the project is to consolidate all the learning I have done so far with AI Core Skills.
I have learnt a great deal about python, machine learning and Git. I still have a lot to learn and am hopeful I can secure a role that enables me to learn on the job.

## Installation
I completed this project on Visual Studio Code using Python and Git.
## Usage
Input your guesses to see if you can guess the word randomly generated.
